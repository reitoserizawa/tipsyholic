<h2>Backstory</h2>
<p>
This is a collaborative project with another developer, Alina from Flatiron School. Alina and I are a former bartender.
Being a bartender, we sometimes got an cocktail order that we weren't sure of its recipe.
</p>

<p>
In addtion, there are cocktail lovers who love to be adventurous and try a new cocktail.
</p>

<p>
We made this application to help bartenders and people who love to try a randomly picked coktail.
